            Facebook, Inc. is an American multinational technology company based in Menlo Park, California. It was founded in 2004 as TheFacebook by Mark Zuckerberg, Eduardo Saverin, Andrew McCollum, Dustin Moskovitz, and Chris Hughes, roommates and students at Harvard College. The namesake social networking service eventually became Facebook, amassing 2.9 billion monthly users by 2021. The company acquired Instagram in 2012, then WhatsApp and Oculus in 2014. It is one of the world's most valuable companies and is considered one of the Big Five companies in U.S. information technology, alongside Google, Apple, Microsoft and Amazon. The company generates substantially all of its revenue by selling advertisement placements to marketers

          Twitter is an American microblogging and social networking service on which users post and interact with messages known as "tweets". Registered users can post, like, and retweet tweets, but unregistered users can only read those that are publicly available. Users interact with Twitter through browser or mobile frontend software, or programmatically via its APIs. Prior to April 2020 services were accessible via SMS. The service is provided by Twitter, Inc., a corporation based in San Francisco, California, and has more than 25 offices around the world. Tweets were originally restricted to 140 characters, but the limit was doubled to 280 for non-CJK languages in November 2017. Audio and video tweets remain limited to 140 seconds for most accounts.

Users can browse other users' content by tags and locations and view trending content. Users can like photos and follow other users to add their content to a personal feed.
